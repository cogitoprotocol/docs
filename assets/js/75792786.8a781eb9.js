In a conventional fixed-exchange-rate regime, a central bank stands ready to use its foreign reserves to exchange for domestic currency if there are persistent deviations from the peg. When the domestic currency\u2019s value trades below the peg, the central bank reduces the supply of domestic currency by selling foreign reserves. The stability mechanism is thus supply-driven in the case of a central bank-managed peg. QTM helps us understand how money moves and how to adjust the money supply.QTM was later updated by Milton Friedman who argues that a central bank policy should aim at keeping the growth of the money supply at a rate commensurate with the growth in productivity. According to Friedman, ",(0,n.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},'"The stock of money ',"[",'should be] increased at a fixed rate year-in and year-out without any variation in the rate of increase to meet cyclical needs"')," (Friedman, 1960).Historical data analysis shows that QTM explains practical monetary behavior only in certain contexts and within certain bounds. Statistically, there has not been a strong correlation between changes in money supply and inflation/deflation, either among traditional currencies (Wang, 2017) or cryptocurrencies (Withiam, 2020). Partly, this has been because other factors such as financial innovation, market sentiment and political dynamics have proved dominant. However, it has also likely been partly because central bankers and their crypto analogues have tended to avoid extremely unwise money supply adjustments due to the warnings posed by QTM theory."),(0,n.kt)("h4",{id:"tobin-tax-theory"},"Tobin tax theory"),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"The Tobin tax theory is based on the concept of a tax on international financial transactions designed to control exchange rate volatility. Makiko Mita points out that the Tobin Tax mechanism tells us how to stabilize stablecoin prices by including transaction fees. When users buy or sell a stablecoin and cause the price to deviate from other currencies (eg. USD), a high transaction fee is applied to disincentivize trading. On the other hand, when users buy or sell a stablecoin and cause the price to match other currencies, a low transaction fee is applied and users are incentivized to continue.Transaction fees can also be utilized to help disincentivize destructive behaviors by bad actors. As Makiko Mita pointed out, as long as a stablecoin is designed to peg to something, it is exposed to the risk of speculative attacks aimed at moving the value away from the peg so as to profit from the necessary efforts to move it back. To mitigate speculative attacks, Spahn proposed a high transaction tax for speculative trading showing hallmarks of a speculative attack. However, he also pointed out that it is \u201cvirtually impossible to distinguish between normal liquidity trading and speculative \u201cnoise\u201d trading.\u201d Spahn expanded the Tobin tax to \u201ca two-tier rate structure consisting of a low-rate financial transactions tax, plus an exchange surcharge at prohibitive rates as a piggyback. The latter would be dormant in times of normal financial activities and be activated only in the case of speculative attacks\u201d.

To avoid this game theoretic dynamic and prevent bank runs, they fall back to the tried and true mechanism of deposit insurance.

With collateralized stablecoins, for instance, there is generally no equivalent of a central bank actively participating in the market to stabilize the peg. Instead, most stablecoin systems generate price stabilization through demand-driven flows to arbitrage differences between the intended peg and the rate in the secondary market. As soon as the price of the stablecoin rises above parity, there is an incentive to deposit fiat currency to mint coins and sell them in the secondary market.
