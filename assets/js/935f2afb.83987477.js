Cogito\u2019s tracercoin tokens are different from any other stablecoins or cryptographic tokens because they are designed not to maintain a stable value relative to one or more fiat currencies or commodities, but are instead soft-pegged to non-financial indices that represent the steady progress of humanity.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"equations/adp-and-reserve-management":{"id":"equations/adp-and-reserve-management","title":"ADP and Reserve Management","description":"The Algorithmic Deposit Protocol (ADP) is created with the ultimate goal of providing passive income to users whose interest is aligned with the long-term vision of the project. This reward is represented by an annual percentage yield (APY) in the form of both stablecoins and CGV tokens (figure 2). The reward is achieved by diversifying the illiquid reserve into different investment options with varying risks and volatility, e.g. deposit pools, proof-of-stake rewards, business-to-business lending, yield farming pools, and direct investment in volatile assets, in order to generate realistic and sustainable returns. The rate depends on the tenors deposited into the ADP and long-term deposits are incentivized with higher yields, in a non-linear manner.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"equations/asp-and-open-market-operations":{"id":"equations/asp-and-open-market-operations","title":"ASP and Open Market Operations","description":"The Algorithmic Stability Protocol (ASP) is created with the primary goal of stabilizing the system (figure 3). Initially, liquidity for the tracercoins will be provided in the form of a tracercoin/stablecoin pair on a Uniswap v2 AMM, which is the dominant AMM for DEXs in crypto currently. This allows the ASP to leverage the liquid reserve to rebalance the pool on a regular basis to support the price range.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"equations/capital-adequacy-ratio":{"id":"equations/capital-adequacy-ratio","title":"Capital Adequacy Ratio","description":"An in-depth explanation of Cogito\'s core concepts","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"fundamentals/design":{"id":"fundamentals/design","title":"Design","description":"Core concepts for Cogito\'s protocols and a utility token","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"fundamentals/origins":{"id":"fundamentals/origins","title":"Origins","description":"The concept behind Cogito tracercoins is to define cryptocurrencies whose value is tied to the steady progress of humanity along some measurable axes. The further and faster progress occurs, the more each token is worth. Within this framework, Cogito will initially create a GCOIN that is soft pegged within specific trading boundaries (an upper bound and a lower bound) to a green index.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"fundamentals/the-index":{"id":"fundamentals/the-index","title":"The Index","description":"How Cogito\'s tracercoins will track progress of humanity","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"intro":{"id":"intro","title":"Introduction","description":"Creating decentralized and AI-driven stable asset that achieves smooth price behavior via peg to non-financial indices","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"overview/cogito-in-a-nutshell":{"id":"overview/cogito-in-a-nutshell","title":"Cogito in a nutshell","description":"Core concepts of the Cogito\'s design","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"overview/market-context":{"id":"overview/market-context","title":"Market context","description":"Volatility is the main challenge for mass adoption of crypto for payment","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"overview/overview-of-stablecoins":{"id":"overview/overview-of-stablecoins","title":"Overview of stablecoins","description":"Stablecoins are essential for DeFi","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"overview/price-stabilization-mechanisms":{"id":"overview/price-stabilization-mechanisms","title":"Price stabilization mechanisms","description":"While stablecoins are a relatively new entrant into the financial arena, the core concepts and methods of price stabilization underlying them are familiar to traditional economics.
